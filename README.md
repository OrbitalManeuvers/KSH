Kerbal Science History is a standalone Windows-based mission planning tool. It displays a historical view of the science experiments you've run, and where you've run them. 

This tool pairs well with the in-game mod SituationModuleInfo to help design the optimal science loadout for each mission.

Works with:
 - all recent versions of KSP
 - any planet pack
